        <h3>User Flow Diagrams and Customer Journey Maps</h3>

        <p>Today in class we discussed user flow diagrams and customer journey maps. These are both things I have done before in previous courses so I already knew how to make them and what to include, however I did learn more about the proper syntax for a user flow diagram (i.e. what shapes to use) as this was not something I had considered before.</p> 
        
        <p>We did an activity using the Spongebob example and created a user flow and customer journey map for his scenario.</p>

        <p>Here is the user flow:</p>

        <p>Here is the customer journey map:</p>
        <img src="Images/Customer-journey-map-activity.jpg">

        <p>I think that these are going to be useful when creating my website/brief, as it will allow me to think more about how my user/character would actually use my website and what parts of it I need to focus on so that I can make an outcome that solves the user's problem.</p>

        <h3>Coding Activity - Box Models</h3>

        <p>We also did an activity in class based on the CSS box models lecture from last week. Again, this was very much a refresher on how margin and padding worked but this is something that will definitely come in handy when I am coding my website(s) as it will help me create a nice layout with good spacing between elements.</p>

        <p>Here is the hand drawn version of my box model:</p>

        <p>Here is the coded version:</p>

        <h3>Divs and Flexbox</h3>
    
        <p>The video lecture this week was about using divs and flexbox. Divs are something that I had used before, however the flexbox material was new to me. Whenever I have had to code a website before I always had difficulty trying to centre items and make responsive columns and rows that stayed in the correct proportions. This method of doing it (using 'display: flex') is a really easy and clear way of getting it to work and is definitely something I will use going forward. It will make laying out items within divs a lot easier and will make it more efficient when it comes to making the website responsive.</p>
