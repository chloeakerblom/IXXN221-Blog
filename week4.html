    <title>Week 4 - User Flows, Customer Journey Maps and CSS Box Models</title>
</head>

    <h3>Week Four - 01/08/22</h3>

    <p>Today in class we discussed user flow diagrams and customer journey maps. These are both things I have done before in previous courses so I already knew how to make them and what to include. We did an activity using the Spongebob example and created a user flow and customer journey map for his scenario.</p>

    <p>I think that these are going to be useful when creating my website/brief, as it will allow me to think more about how my user/character would actually use my website and what parts of it I need to focus on so that I can make an outcome that solves the user's problem.</p>
