    <h3>Week 8 - 12/09/22</h3>

    <p>Today's leture was about typography in web design. It discussed using approprate fonts regarding emotion and practicality, as well as hierarchy, weight and spacing. Choosing the right font is important, especially when the content of a website is wordy and/or important. It needs to be accessible to users by being large enough to read and simple enough to distinguish letters. The aesthetic of the font also has to match the vibe of the website. Choosing the right font for my website is going to be important so that it makes the information on the page easy to understand and doesn't draw focus away from the actual content. I think I will use a simple sans serif to keep it legible and modern.</p>

    <h4>Project 2a Progress</h4>
    <p>Today we did in-class presentations and got feedback on our work. Overall, the tutors were happy with my progress so far, however they had a few comments. The main comment was around the scaling of elements. Everything was too big - something that was more obvious on screen than on paper. They also said that I should play around with a few different layouts, potentially making my images grids have less columns and having the images bigger. Another suggestion was that I could add some transparency to the images so that the text on top of them didn't have to have a box around it. They pointed out the inconsistencies in the headers, as each had a slightly different layout. Finally, they suggested some place where I could had some affordances to help the user navigate the site.</p>

    <p>After receiving this feedback, I began to make some changes to my site. I stated by shrinking a lot of the elements to make them look more proportionate to the screen size. I then readjusted the layouts of a few pages, particularly the forum and answer pages. I moved the filters to the left side of the filter page and put the question grid next to it. I alternated the colours of each of the boxes to distinuish them from each other and I changed the size and colour of the 'Ask a Question' button. I feel like this layout looks a lot better than the previous version. On the answers page, I changed it so that there was one column of answers in the centre of the page and moved the 'Answer this Question' box to trhe bottom with a new carousel of suggested questions. I moved the text box as someone using the site is more likely to wan to see the answers rather than answer the question themselves, and I added a carousel as something I identified in my customer journey map was that people would want suggestions for alternative questions to helo them find the help they are looking for.</p>

    <p>Across the whole design, I made the headers more consistent as well as the text alignments. I also changed my colour palette to use a dark blue rather than a light blue. This creates more contrast dominance and makes the website look a lot more professional. I think it looks much better now and suits the site more.</p>

    <p>After making these changes, I got some more feedback from my tutors. Overall, they liked the changes I had made but had a few more suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More consistency with my buttons and their sizes, as well as making their hover states more obvious</li>
        <li>Utilise the Material Design icons to make them look more professional</li>
        <li>Get rid of some of the tan colour as it doesn't quie work</li>
        <li>More the filters to the top of the filter page so the rest of the content can be centred</li>
        <li>Change the active state on the navigation to use colour rather than underline</li>
        <li>Add more detail to the question cards, like categories tags</li>
        <li>Keep playing around with the size of the grids</li>
        <li>Fix little things like strokes and font sizes.</li>
    </ul>
