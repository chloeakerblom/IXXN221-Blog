        <h3>User Personas and Empathy Maps</h3>

        <p>In class this week, we learnt about user personas and empathy maps. We did two group activities on this to start to think about how to construct these and what kind of things we need to think about when creating them. As I am sick this lesson, I attended class on Zoom and my group created a Miro Board to do the activities.</p>

        <p>This is our User Persona:</p>

        <p>This is our Empathy Map:</p>

        <p>As I am an Interaction Design major and did the Design for Experience paper last trimester, I have looked at user personas before however not in much detail. Empathy maps were a new tool I learnt about today and found that they will be useful when learning about my end users as I will have to think about the potential user's actions as well as their thoughts and feelings, which is something that will influence the way I design my website.</p>

        <p>I think that these tools are going to be useful for designing a website as they allow us to think more deeply about the needs of our users and how we can cater to them. They can give us a specific enough demographic that is also broad enough to be aware of the differences in people's needs. By using these tools I will be able to better design a website that fulfils the needs and wants of the user and will be able to create a successful outcome.</p>

        <h3>More HTML Basics</h3>

        <p>This week's lecture was about more HTML basics around adding links and lists. Again as I have done HTML before, this lecture was just a bit of a refresher for me, however the 'target="_blank"' syntax to make the link open in a new tab was something that I did not know about before. This could be useful if I need to add external links to my websites as I find it can sometimes be annoying when a new page replaces the current page you are on.</p>
