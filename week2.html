    <h3>Week Two - 18/07/22</h3>

    <p>In class this week, we learnt about user personas and empathy maps. We did two group activities on this to start to think about how to construct these and what kind of things we need to think about when creating them. As I am sick this lesson, I attended class on Zoom and my group created a Miro Board to do the activities.</p>

    <p>This is our User Persona:</p>

    <p>This is our Empathy Map:</p>

    <p>As I am an Interaction Design major and did the Design for Experience paper last trimester, I have looked at user personas before however not in much detail. Empathy maps were a new tool I learnt about today and found that they will be useful when learning about my end users as I will have to think about the potential user's actions as well as their thoughts and feelings, which is something that will influence the way I design my website.</p>

    <p>I think that these tools are going to be useful for designing a website as they allow us to think more deeply about the needs of our users and how we can cater to them. They can give us a specific enough demographic that is also broad enough to be aware of the differences in people's needs. By using these tools I will be able to better design a website that fulfils the needs and wants of the user and will be able to create a successful outcome.</p>
