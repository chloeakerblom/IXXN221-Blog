    <h3>Weeks One - 11/07/22</h3>

    <p>In the lecture of our first lesson, we looked at basic HTML and how to use headings, paragraphs and images. I have done quite a bit of HTML/CSS at high school, however I have not done it since. This lecture was a good refresher for how to set up a file and add the basics.</p>

    <p>Below is a screenshot of me practicing the skills and making sure I could get VSCode to work:</p>
