        <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
        <p>In the lecture of our first lesson, we looked at basic HTML and how to use headings, paragraphs and images. I have done quite a bit of HTML/CSS at high school, however I have not done it since, so this lecture was a good refresher for how to set up a file and add the basics. This will be useful for when I get to actually coding my website/blog as these things are the fundamentals of web development and will come in handy whenever I find myself needing to code a website.</p>

        <p>This lesson has also introduced me to Visual Studio Code. It is a software I haven't used before so I have now learnt the basics of how to create a file/folder system and the main shortcuts.</p>

        <p>Below is a screenshot of me practicing the skills and making sure I could get VSCode to work:</p>
