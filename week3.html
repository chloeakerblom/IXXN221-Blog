    <title>Week 3 - Goals and Assignment One Progress</title>
</head>
<body>

    
    <h3>Weeks Three - 25/07/22</h3>

    <p>In class today we looked at user and designer goals, and how to identify shared goals. We are able to do this using venn diagrams to find the common ground between the two groups.</p>

    <p>I think this is going to be a useful thing to do when coming up with the concept for my website as it will help me think about my user more and how I can design my website to fit their needs. It will also give me guidelines to go back to as I create my website to make sure I am following my brief and creating an outcome that is fit for purpose.</p>

    <h4>Assignment Progress</h4>

    <p>I have been a little bit stuck on my assignment as I am unsure what character to choose for my user persona. I have created a list of characters from things I have recently watched and childhood favourites, so my next steps will be to pick a few of these characters and have a bit of a brainstorm for each of them to see who I could use for my final character.</p>


    <h3> Week Three - Weekend Progress (31/07/22)</h3>

    <p>Over the weekend I have been working on creating the user persona and empathy map for my chosen fictional character. I have been having a bit of trouble deciding who to use but, after creating a long list of possible characters, I have settled on using Homer Simpson. he has a lot of personality traits and weaknesses that I can develop a website for. I have decided to focus on his lack of DIY skill for the topic of my website. In several episodes he attempts to build or fix things that go wrong, in particular when <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSGEzpkgsu0' target="_blank">he attempts to build a BBQ but drops the instructions in the cement.</a> I am thinking of creating a website that will help people with basic DIY skills, bith around simple projects and tool how-tos.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of my user persona and empathy maps. I have not had time to lay them out nicely so I have just listed all of the ideas and will create the layout later.</p>

    <p>Overall, I am happy with my choice of character as I feel there is a lot of material to base my idea off of, even if I change my mind and move away from the DIY idea. My next steps will be to make the venn diagram of goals and to layout the persona and map in a nice document.</p>
