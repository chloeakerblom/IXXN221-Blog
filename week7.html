        <h3>Colour Theory</h3>

        <p>Today's lecture discussed colour theory in web design, particularly the importance of contrast. Having contrasting colours allows elements to stand out and creates hierarchy on the page. It also makes the page look nice (as long as the colours don't clash). Contrast can come from lightness, saturation and opposites on the colour wheel. One new thing I learnt today was about colour dominance - having lots of variation in the saturation of colours. I think this is a very effective technique and is something I should utilise in my website. It will make the most important elements on my page stand out, such as the call to action buttons, so that the users don't have to hunt for important information.</p>

        <p>This is an important concept in web design, particularly when looking at accessibility as it makes the website easier to look at and makes the text easier to read. This is something that would be good to incorporate into any website to accommodate for those with vision issues or colour blindness.</p>

        <h3>UX Laws</h3>

        <p>This weeks video lecture covered UX laws and how we could incorporate them into our websites. The main laws discussed were Fitts' Law, Hick's Law, Jakob's Law, the Law of PrÃ¤gnanz and the Law of Proximity.</p>

        <p>I had learnt about the UX laws in the first year Interaction Design paper I did last year, therefore these concepts were not new to me. However, this lecture made me think about them in more depth within the context of web design. There are lots of little things on websites that you don't really think about but are actually very important to the overall functionality of the website. Mental models, Gestalt principles, size and shape all play a big part in how well a website functions, so it is important to think about them when designing as it will help make sure your website is user friendly.</p>

        <p>After watching this lecture, I went and looked at the website and looked at all of the other UX laws to find other ones that might be relevant to my design. The Von Restorff Effect, Miller's Law and the Law of Common Region are all things that I think will be important  to incorporate into my design to help my user navigate my website easily and will make the information presented to them easy to understand.</p>

        <h3>Coding Activity - Grids</h3>
        <p>The activity for today was to make a copy of the grid layout shown in the slides. After looking back at the tutorial video on how the grid layouts worked (as it had been a while since I had first watched it) I managed to get the layout quite easily. However I did get a bit stuck with getting the middle row of columns to work. I realised thought that I was missing the 'display: grid;' line of code, and once I had put that in it all worked fine. This skill will be particularly useful when it comes to coding my website as I will be able to make even and effective grids that will be responsive to different screen sizes, which is very important since my website is going to have a very grid-based layout.</p>

        <h3>Project 2a Progress</h3>

        <p>After completing my sketches over the break, in today's class I began creating my blockframes on Figma. I transfered the layout directly from my sketches.</p>

        <img src="Images/Blockframes.PNG">

        <p>Next, I created a moodboard to get an idea of what kind of colours I wanted to use for my website. I decided on using blue as the main colour for my website as it has been found to help people learn/focus better, and is also quite calming and sparks creativity. To contrast, I have chosen yellow as my secondary colour to help highlight elements and add an optimistic feeling.</p>

        <img src="Images/Moodboard.jpg">

        <p>I then started to add these colours to my blockframes to start to build up my hi-fi prototype. I have chosen to add a beige as another colour option that is less bright to help distinguish sections. I have tried to follow the Law of Common Region to help group elements to make the layout even easier to follow. I am not 100% happy with the colour placements yet. I think the blue might be too pale as there is quite a low contrast dominance. I might use a darker shade in my next iterations.</p>
