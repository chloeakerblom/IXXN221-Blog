    <h3>Week 12 - 10/10/22</h3>

    <p>Overall, I have really enjoyed this course. I feel that I have learnt a lot more about web design and how to analyse a user group to design for their needs/wants. While I had done some HTML and CSS before, however I have definitely learned more about responsive design and how to work a grid system effectively.</p>

    <p>The first project also taught me about different research methods that are used in the industry, and I feel this will be really useful when it comes to the rest of my studies and beyond. </p>
