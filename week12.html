        <h3>Assignment Two Part Two Hand In</h3>

        <p>Today I handed in my coded website and presented it to the class. Overall, I am happy with how my website turned out. I am quite proud of how closely it resembles my Figma designs and its functionality as a whole. If I had more time I would have liked to have worked more on the responsiveness of the design, as while it looks good on mobile and desktop, the inbetween and larger sizes aren't fully responsive so some of the elements begin to overlap each other.</p>

        <p>I am glad that I chose to code my website rather than use EditorX as it has given me a challenge that has helped me boost my coding and debugging skills, and I feel that this will be useful going forward if I ever have to design or develop a website in the real world.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>Overall, I have really enjoyed this course. I feel that I have learnt a lot more about web design and how to analyse a user group to design for their needs/wants. While I had done some HTML and CSS before, I have definitely learned more about responsive design and how to work a grid system effectively.</p>

        <p>The first project also taught me about different research methods that are used in the industry, and I feel this will be really useful when it comes to the rest of my studies and beyond, no matter what type of field I end up working in. </p>
