    <h3>Mid-Trimester Break</h3>

    <p>Over the break, I started doing some sketches of what my website might look like. I started out by printing off my user flow diagram from the last project and grouping the steps together to figure out what my web pages were going to be.</p>

    <p>I settled on having nine different pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Find a Guide</li>
        <li>Category page</li>
        <li>Search results</li>
        <li>Guide instructions</li>
        <li>Forum</li>
        <li>Ask a Question</li>
        <li>Post Made</li>
        <li>Answer page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I then began to sktech a few different layouts for my website. Below are the sketches of the design I settled on. I have chosen to use a simple linear grid layout so that it is easy for my users to follow and understand.</p>
